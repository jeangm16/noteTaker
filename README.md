# Note Taker: Homework

## Description

Create an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

* The application frontend has already been created, it's your job to build the backend and connect the two.

* The following HTML routes should be created:

  * GET `/notes` - Should return the `notes.html` file.

  * GET `*` - Should return the `index.html` file

* The application should have a `db.json` file on the backend that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the `fs` module.
